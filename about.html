                <h2>A Heart for Healing & Transformation</h2>
                <p>
                    Malikka Sims is the founder and host of Reflections with Malikka, a faith-based podcast created from a personal journey of healing, restoration, and obedience to God. Through seasons of loss, growth, and deep reflection, Malikka learned that healing does not happen by accident, it happens when we are willing to pause, look inward, and invite God into the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a heart for authenticity and transformation, Malikka creates spaces where honesty is welcomed, faith is centered, and healing is not rushed. Her voice carries compassion, wisdom, and a deep reliance on Christ, encouraging others to reflect on their own lives with grace and truth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the core of Malikka's work is a desire to see hearts restored, minds renewed, and lives transformed, not by perfection, but by surrender. She believes that reflection is often the doorway God uses to bring healing and lasting change.

                <h2>The Birth of Reflections</h2>
                <p>
                    Reflections was born in the quiet moments after the storm in the silence that came once the noise of addiction faded and the truth of who I really was began to surface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This podcast is more than a platform. It's a mirror.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was birthed from the ashes of my own story a life once tangled in addiction, shame, trauma, and self abandonment. I know what it feels like to be lost, to be unseen, to seek love in people, places, and things only to find more emptiness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But God met me in the middle of my breakdown and began a healing that started not with fixing everyone around me, but with handing me a mirror.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I looked at the women triggering me in recovery, I realized I wasn't supposed to pray them awayI was supposed to reflect. God showed me it wasn't about them. It was about <em>me.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    About what still lived beneath the surface. About the wounds I buried under survival. About the trauma I never dared to name. And in that secret place with God, with scripture and surrender and honest conversation, Reflections was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This podcast is a sacred space where we look inward through God's truth. Where we hold up mirrors to our pain, patterns, and purpose,and allow the Light to do what only Light can do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's raw. It's real. It's redemptive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflections is where healing meets transformation. Where conversations with other women turn into lifelines. Where vulnerability becomes victory. Where shame dies and identity rises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is for every woman who's still becoming, and needs a place to reflect, to grow, to remember:
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: var(--primary-purple); font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    You are not your past.<br>
                    You are not what you've survived.<br>
                    You are not forgotten.<br><br>
                    You are being made new.<br><br>
                    And this—this is your space to reflect and rise.

                <h2>A Personal Word</h2>
                <blockquote class="featured-quote">
                    "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."
                    <cite>— Jeremiah 29:11</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Jeremiah 29:11 has been a quiet promise for me and my son a reminder that even when life feels uncertain or unfinished, God's plans remain intentional and hope filled. This verse doesn't deny the pain; it speaks into it, assuring us that what we endure is not wasted and not the end. It tells us God sees beyond this moment and is gently guiding us toward a future of peace, purpose, and restoration. It's our reminder that we are held, becoming, and still being led by a God who knows exactly where He's taking us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for being here. Thank you for trusting this space with your heart and your time. I pray that through these conversations, you'll discover that healing is possible, transformation is real, and God is always working — even in the pause, even in the reflection.
